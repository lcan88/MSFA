\title{Variance matrix of MLE estimates for a MSFA model}
\usage{
vcov_msfa(X_s, param, getgrad = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X_s}{List of lenght \eqn{S}{S}, corresponding to number of different studies considered.
Each element of the list contains a data matrix, with the same number of columns \eqn{P}{P} for all
the studies.}

\item{param}{A list with the same slots as that returned by \code{ecm_msfa}.}

\item{getgrad}{Should the function return also the gradient at \code{param}? Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A list with exactly the same structure of the three slots \code{Phi}, \code{Lambda_s} and
\code{Psi_s} of \code{param}, but containing the standard errors rather than the point estimates.
Furthemore, slots for the hessian matrix and the gradient at \code{param} are included, the latter
is not NULL when \code{getgrad}  is \code{TRUE}.
}
\description{
Computes the inverse observed information for a MSFA model
}
\details{
Numerical differentiation is employed to obtain the observed information matrix at a
given parameter values, so that when the parameter values equals the MLE the function
returns the estimated variance matrix of the fitted model. The method is rather inefficient, and
it may lead to long computations, though the function is designed to be called only once after the
estimation has been carried out. However, it would be relatively straightforward to employ analytical
differentiation at least for the log-likelihood gradient, and this may be implemented in future
releases of the code.
