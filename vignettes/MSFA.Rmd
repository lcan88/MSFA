The following example illustrates how to fit a MSFA model via the ECM Algorithm, 
using a data set available in the Bioconductor repository (\link{www.bioconductor.org}). 

## Getting the data
Some pre-processing is required to get the data into a form suitable for the
analysis. This was already done, and the resulting data frame is saved into the
`data_immune` object. The commands that were used to form it are included
in the help file for the data object.
```{r help, echo = TRUE, results = TRUE, tidy = TRUE}
library(MSFA)
data(data_immune)
help(data_immune)
```

## Obtaining suitable starting values for model parameters
Then we get suitable starting values for model parameters, selecting $K=4$ common
factors and $2, 3$ study-specific factors for the two studies, respectively.
```{r, starting values, messages = FALSE}
start_value <- start_msfa(X_s = data_immune, k = 4, j_s = c(2, 3))
```

## Fitting the model via ECM
Now everything is in place for estimating the model parameters via the ECM algorithm
```{r, get estimate, results = FALSE, cache =TRUE}
mle <-  ecm_msfa(data_immune, start_value, trace = FALSE)
```
The estimated matrix of common loadings can be represented by a suitable heatmap:
```{r, heatmap, fig.show='hold', fig.width=9.5, fig.height=6.5, message = FALSE}
library(gplots)
heatmap.2(mle$Phi,dendrogram='none', Rowv=FALSE, Colv=FALSE,trace='none', density.info="none", col=heat.colors(256))
```
